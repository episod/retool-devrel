# Developer relations at Retool execrise

In Retool developer relations, we want to inspire developers to not only build great apps but inspire others, often in the same organization, to build great apps too!

To scale helping inspire learners to become builders and then become teachers, we're considering ways to help developers learn from the works of others with the help of generative AI.

In this exercise, you will attempt to read and follow a tutorial generated from a JSON export of a simple weather dashboard app built by the hiring manager. The integration uses weather APIs that do not require authentication and AI integration features built into Retool. You don't need to complete the tutorial or follow it exactly to complete the exercise. Use it as a starting to point to work through the developer loop of resources, queries, and components -- especially if you aren't already familiar with Retool apps.

Limit yourself to about an hour to explore! If you find the whole thing distateful -- go explore other tutorials in [Retool documentation](https://docs.retool.com/) or [Retool University](https://university.retool.com/). In any case, come back and answer the questions below to your best ability.

## Questions to consider

And then spend some fresh moments answering the following questions, or ones like it, in a brief write-up. We aren't looking for right answers, just how you think through the possibilities, your instincts, and preferences.

How would you go about respectfully describing to an engineer how to point and click their way through a customizable user interface like the Retool development environment?

Why would you or would you not use AI generated content like this again to kickstart a project or concept?

How would you influence the creation of tutorials like these to benefit self-serve use by Retool developers in large enterprises looking to learn from their peers?

What software, frameworks, services, or APIs are you excited to teach people to integrate with Retool?
