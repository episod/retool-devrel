# retool-devrel

I lead developer relations at Retool. You can [learn more about what we're doing in Retool DevRel](https://retool.com/blog/retool-developer-relations).

These are public projects related to my work incubating a new team at Retool.

* `weather-dashboard` is a good first Retool project for learning resources, queries, and components.
  * `weather-dashboard.json` is a Retool App export of what's described in the tutorial. It's not very human readable. But the app itself was built by a human.
  * [`tutorial.md`](weather-dashboard/tutorial.md) was mostly generated by AI based on the JSON file above. The intention is that a human follows the tutorial to build the app and then reflect on the experience. It's a great starting place for writing a real tutorial too.
  * [`prompt.md`](weather-dashboard/prompt.md) is additional context provided to the AI writing the tutorial, tying in a story about a developer advocacy role the reader is interviewing for at Retool. This is real! That's why this repo is here. Good luck!
